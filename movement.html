  <p>
    The Flux movement is an international effort to promote a better system of democracy across the globe, one which will deliver better policy, include more voices, and have more prosperous outcomes for our society.
    <br><br>
    The movement is one of political expression, not ideology. Its principle endeavour is the success of non-partisan political parties, which provide citizens direct access to real political power via <i>The Flux System</i> outside of election cycles.  
    <br><br>
    The Flux Foundation serves as a link between Flux chapters and provides direction, cohesion, support and technology to the movement.
