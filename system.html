  <p>
    The Flux System is a form of participatory democracy called ‘Issue Based Direct Democracy’ or IBDD.
    <br><br>
    IBDD was designed to aleviate the challenges faced by representative democracy. By leveraging our combined skills, knowledge, and experience, IBDD allows each and every one of us to contribute directly to the decision making process.
    <br><br>
    The Foundation is championing IBDD as a viable model for democracies around the globe well into the 21st century and beyond.
